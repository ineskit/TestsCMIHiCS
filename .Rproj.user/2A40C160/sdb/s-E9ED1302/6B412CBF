Download the dataset into the *datasets* folder\n\n2. Choose algorithms, if necessary apply changes in line:\n```R\n  algorithms <- c(\"HiCS\", \"CMI\", \"GMD\")\n```  \n*Notes:*\n-\tplease make sure that you've got 1 RData-resultfile per dataset\n  If you don’t want to change the general behaviour of the markdown, run for every dataset a single experiment\n-\tthere can be several algorithms within 1 RData-file\n\n3. Source the *HICSvsCMI_Experiments.R* script\n4. Start experiment by calling **runExperiments**-function, for example:\n```R\n  finalResult <- runExperiments(inputPath = \"datasets\", maxMinPts = 100, numCores=1, topkSearch = 500, topkOutput = 100)\n```\n\n5. file experimentResult.RData is generated with the results in folder “result” \n6. load your new results in the file  generatePlots.R under \n```R\n## ---- loadData\nload(\"results/Param_100_050_020_SSVec/experimentResult_ann_161129.RData\")\n```\n\n\n\n##References\nThe package *R-Subcon* containing several subspace search algorithm [1]\n\nThe package *knitr* [2] \n\n[1]: https://github.com/holtri/Rsubcon\n[2]: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/knitr/index.html\n\n",
